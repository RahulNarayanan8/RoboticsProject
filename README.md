Final Robotics Project Fall 2023. Translation from handwritten text to robot writing.

Robot takes in an image of handwritten text. One such image is called final_img.jpg in the repository. It then uses EasyOCR (a python library for optical character recognition) to translate this handwritten text into a machine encoded string. 

The robot then takes this string and writes each letter one after the other using a pencil or marker attached to its side. For our project we chose to write the string Pinto (as an homage to our Professor).
